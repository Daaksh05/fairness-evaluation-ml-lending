# Experimental Results

---

## Dataset Summary
- Number of records: 10  
- Target variable: loan_status  
- Sensitive attribute: gender  

---

## Model Performance
- Model used: Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy: 100% (small dataset)  

> Note: High accuracy is expected due to small dataset size.

---

## Fairness Metrics
- Demographic Parity Rate (Female): 0.5  
- Disparate Impact (DI): 1.0  

---

## Interpretation
- The model shows no strong evidence of bias for the tested sensitive attribute.
- Results are not statistically strong due to limited data size.

---

## Observations
- Fairness metrics complement traditional ML evaluation.
- Larger datasets are required for reliable fairness conclusions.
