# 📘 Fairness Evaluation of ML Models in Financial Lending Data

This project investigates **bias and fairness** in machine learning models used for financial lending decisions such as loan approval and credit risk assessment. The goal is to evaluate whether models behave equitably across demographic groups (e.g., gender, age, socioeconomic groups) and to apply fairness-enhancing mitigation strategies.

The project is designed as a **computational social science** and **responsible AI** study, integrating machine learning, fairness metrics, interpretability, and ethical evaluation.
